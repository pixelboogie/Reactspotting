# Reactspotting: Dice Game

## Description
Reactspotting is an engaging dice game built with React.js that challenges players to roll ten dice until all display the same value. This project is a showcase of advanced React features including lazy state initialization, conditional rendering, and effective state management using functional components.

## Features
- **Lazy State Initialization**: Optimizes resource use by initializing state only when needed, enhancing application performance.
- **Dynamic Component Rendering**: Dice and game elements are rendered dynamically, managed through a central state for real-time interaction.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can "hold" dice between rolls to strategize their approach to achieving matching dice.
- **Celebratory Animations**: Features like a Confetti component enhance user engagement by celebrating victories visually.
